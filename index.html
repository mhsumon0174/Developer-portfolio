            <h1>Dream Big</h1>
            <h3>Become Captain Marvel</h3>


            <p>We all know Captain Marvel says she’s more than capable of going “higher, further,
                faster” than the
                average bad guy and can definitely help in defeating Thanos, but just how strong is Captain Marvel
                really? In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Carol Danvers, aka Captain Marvel, is an impulsive United
                States Air Force pilot exposed to the energy of the Tesseract (which housed the Space Stone) while
                unknowingly amid an inter-universe war. The explosion gave her powerful superhuman powers and abilities.
                She was abducted soon after by the Kree, who intended to use her as a weapon, and was subjected to a
                Kree blood transfusion that turned her into a Kree-Human hybrid. </p>
